# Tensorflow
Try to understand the following link https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers, https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py, and implement CNN classifier for MNIST data by adding extra layers or tuning the model using either tensorflowor keras. (Accuracy is not important, but implementation is must) •Download the dataset from following link (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It has both training and test data. If it is computationally expensive, try to use 50% of the data to fit the model.•Implement the model in Python3•Please cite, if you use any existing code or resources.
